                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>
                            My name is Helayna Fuller and I am a fourth year photography student at Grand Valley State University. I have been actively photographing and rounding out my craft for just over ten years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My passion began as a child, being surrounded by lakes, animals, and forests. It was impossible to walk outside and not be in awe of what this world can offer. Starting out with landscape photography, I have worked my way around the medium to become accustomed and infatuated with portraiture, commercial/product photography, sports, and fine art.
                        </p>

                    <div class="about2">
                        <p>
                            Being able to explore different facets of the craft drives my motivation to create photographs that mean something to me; as well as learning what means so much to others. I am constantly moved by the work of my fellow photographers and inspiring work produced by legends who have paved the way for new generations. There is always something to learn.  
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition to studio work and landscape photography, I am currently freelancing for local Grand Valley graduates to provide them with memories of the beginning of a new chapter in their lives.</p>
